		What does the End-User License Agreement do? Why should I read it?
	</div>
	<div class="body_text">
		<b>Scientific Software</b> products are licensed to you, not sold. 
		Under United States and international copyright laws, your right to install, copy and run 
			Scientific Software products is limited. 
		<i>The End-User License Agreement</i> (EULA) contains all the rights and limitations that govern your use of 
			Scientific Software products. 
		The EULA is a contract between you and Scientific Software (or the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) 
			if you acquired the software preinstalled on your computer system). 
		You are required to accept the EULA in order to run Scientific Software products. 
		You should contact the software or computer reseller if you do not want to accept the EULA. 
		Please note that your EULA does not by itself prove that you are legally licensed. 
		The EULA is used as part of the process to determine whether you have genuine software that has been legally licensed. 
	</div>	
	<div class="body_text">	
		Please read the EULA carefully, as you would any legal contract, so you understand your rights and your obligations, 
			and so you understand the rights granted by the licensor. 
		The EULA may limit your ability to make additional copies of the software, 
			and may also grant you specific rights to utilize networks, transfer the software, or otherwise use the software. 
		In addition, please note that under certain Scientific Software volume licensing programs intended for businesses, 
			you may have different rights and limitations with respect to the software 
			than may be contained in the EULA supplied with the software. 
		Please consult the agreements that govern such programs for complete information.

	<div class="body_title">
		Can I make a second copy of my Scientific Software Neuro Laboratory for my portable computer?
	</div>	
	<div class="body_text">		
		The answer is generally, "no." 
		Copyright law and the terms of your End-User License Agreement (EULA) govern your rights to copy and run 
			Scientific Software products. 
		In the case of Scientific Software Neuro Laboratory, the EULA does not permit you to run more than one copy. 
		If your Scientific Software Neuro Laboratory solution was supplied to you preinstalled on a new computer system 
			by an original equipment manufacturer (OEM), different license terms apply. 
		In such cases, you may not make a second copy and the software itself is not transferable to a different computer system, 
			even if you delete it from the original computer system. 
		Please read the EULA contained in this software for complete information. 
	</div>	
	
	<div class="body_title">
		Can I sell or give away old versions of my software when I acquire an upgrade?
	</div>	
	<div class="body_text">
		No. Because the original full version software and the upgrade version software together are a single software program, 
			you will need to retain the prior version in order to establish your eligibility for the upgrade license.	
	</div>	
	
	<div class="body_title">	
		What is software piracy? Why should I be concerned about it?
	</div>	
	<div class="body_text">		
		The term software piracy covers different activities, including: illegal copying of programs, 
			counterfeiting and the distribution of infringing software, and sometimes even sharing a program with a friend. 
		The Business Software Alliance's 2002 Global Piracy Study reports that two out of every five business software 
			applications in use, worldwide, are unlicensed or stolen. 
		In some countries or regions, as many as nine out of every ten business software applications in use are unlicensed or stolen. 
	</div>	
	<div class="body_text">		
		When a consumer decides to use an unauthorized copy of a software program, 
			the consumer forfeits his or her right to the support, documentation, warranties and periodic updates 
			provided by the software manufacturer. 
		In addition, pirated software can contain viruses that could potentially damage the consumer's hard disk and its contents. 
		Finally, if software is illegally copied at work, the customer puts him or herself and the company he or she works 
			for at a legal risk by pirating a program protected by copyright laws.
	</div>	
	<div class="body_text">
		When you acquire counterfeit software, you're supporting disreputable businesses, to the detriment of tax-paying, 
			legitimate businesses that provide jobs and salaries to good citizens and expand the economy. 
		There is a good chance the profits from counterfeit software are funding additional illegitimate businesses. 
		Legitimate companies do not receive funds from the distribution of counterfeit software, 
			and frequently this loss of revenue leads to layoffs for workers in all related industries, 
			from manufacturers to resellers. 
		So, as you can see, acquiring counterfeit software doesn't impact software manufacturers only; it impacts everyone.
