		Solution Description	
	</div>
	<div class="body_text">
		An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is an information processing paradigm that is inspired by the way biological 
			nervous systems, such as the brain, process information. 
		The key element of this paradigm is the novel structure of the information processing system. 
		It is composed of a large number of highly interconnected processing elements (neurones) working in unison 
			to solve specific problems. 
		ANNs, like people, learn by example. 
		An ANN is configured for a specific application, such as pattern recognition or data classification, 
			through a learning process. 
		Learning in biological systems involves adjustments to the synaptic connections that exist between the neurones. 
		This is true of ANNs as well.

		The main idea of <b>Neuro Laboratory</b> solution is visual modelling of neural networks.
		User has an opportunity to select any network architecture and content he want.
		Application includes <b>Network Elements Toolbox</b> - component that contains realization of most commonly used 
			neural cells (simple neuron, RBF cell, Kohonen layer, Hopfield layer and others). 
		Using this toolbox you can build neural network of any required structure.
		<b>Neuro Laboratory</b> also includes components which realize primary algorithms of training and processing neural networks.
	</div>		
	<div class="body_text">
		<b>Neuro Laboratory</b> has well planned plug-ins subsystem so it's functionality can be extended by writing additional modules.
		Definite part of functionality, that has been included in this application version, is already realized 
			in the form of external components.
		They involve specific training algorithms, network processing and network processing visualization.
	</div>
	<div class="body_text">
		Models, built with the help of <b>Neuro Laboratory</b>,  can be exported for latest usage in you custom applications.
		So you have an opportunity to enrich your applications with the power of neural networks.
